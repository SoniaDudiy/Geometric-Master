# Shape Calculator

Geometric Master - this is a simple Python program that calculates the area and perimeter of various 2D shapes. The program supports calculating the area and perimeter of the following shapes:
- Square
- Rectangle
- Triangle
- Circle

## Features
- Calculates area and perimeter for squares, rectangles, triangles, and circles.
- Allows user input for shape parameters from the command line.
- Includes unit tests to ensure correctness of calculations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SoniaDudiy/Test-task-DiversiPy-.git
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```
   python main.py  

## Usage
1. Run the program.
2. Follow the prompts to input the shape and its parameters.
3. The program will calculate and display the area and perimeter of the specified shape.

## Example
```
Shape Area and Perimeter Calculator
-----------------------------------
Available Shapes: Square, Rectangle, Triangle, Circle
Enter the name of the shape: square
Enter the length of a side: 5
Area of the Square: 25
Perimeter of the Square: 20

## Testing
